"""Preference-learning harness (SPEC v3.2 Step 37): does feedback actually
teach Chief? This closes the reward loop the rest of the system implies —

    reward   = user feedback (should / shouldn't-interrupt, ±1)
    policy   = score_and_route(components, per-topic weights)
    training = EMA weight update in core/learner.py::Learner.record
    eval     = routing agreement vs the user's true preference, over rounds

A simulated user has hidden per-topic preferences. Chief starts blind
(uniform weights) and is corrected only by the ±1 signal — no labels, no
gradient, no heavy ML (SPEC §13). A rising agreement curve is the proof that
the reward signal trains the policy; a flat curve would be a regression.

Deterministic and offline: same seed of events every run.
