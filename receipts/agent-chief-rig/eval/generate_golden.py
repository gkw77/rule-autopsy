"""Deterministic generator for eval/golden.jsonl (~200 labeled events).

Labels are RULE-FIRST: each scenario template states the route it must produce
(and why), and generation fails loudly if the real pipeline disagrees — so the
committed labels are verified against the exact production code paths. The
fixture backend therefore scores ~100% (the sanity ceiling); real backends
diverge and that divergence is the capability number.

Run: `uv run python -m eval.generate_golden` (rewrites eval/golden.jsonl).
